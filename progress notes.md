## Day - 0
## Day - 1 (C programming)
 Semicolon [;] is imp
 
 "%d" and addition of "%d" and spacing is imp
 
 "\n" is "enter" to next line ---> also needed for the last new line
 
 To print text and number together we can put all of that in a single printf statement:

      Example: printf("No. of apples is %d" and I ate it all, 3);

         // Output:
        // No. of apples is 3 and I ate it all
'//' is for single line comment, " /* */ " is for multi line comment

## Day - 2
int (just like in.py), assigned for any interger and that variable can be labelled any name and can be used in a string.

    eg: #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    
    int age = 25;
    printf("%d", age);
    }

Data type with eg:
   
     int num = 100000;
     long long large_num = 100000000000000;
     float pi = 3.14;
     double euler_number = 2.718281828459045;
     char c = 'A';
     bool check = true;

## Day - 3 
(Procastinated)

## Day - 4 (Python)
just print(" ") ---> for exact print
print ()----> for variables

  Some variable types in Python are as follows

--> Numeric variables - hold integers and decimal values
    
     age = 25
    temperature = 98.6

--> String variables - Stores a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes
    
    name = "John Doe"
    message = 'Hello, world!'

--> Boolean variables - only hold the values true and false
    
    is_true = True
    is_false = False

--> List variables - Stores a collection of items, which can be of different types.
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

--> Tuple variables
    
    coordinates = (10, 20)

--> Dictionary variables
    
    person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

--> Set variables
    
    unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}

--> None variable
   
    empty_value = None
