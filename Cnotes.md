 Semicolon [;] is imp
 
 "%d" and addition of "%d" and spacing is imp
 
 "\n" is "enter" to next line ---> also needed for the last new line
 
 To print text and number together we can put all of that in a single printf statement:

      Example: printf("No. of apples is %d" and I ate it all, 3);

         // Output:
        // No. of apples is 3 and I ate it all
'//' is for single line comment, " /* */ " is for multi line comment
