 Semicolon [;] is imp
 
 "%d" and addition of "%d" and spacing is imp
 
 "\n" is "enter" to next line ---> also needed for the last new line
 
 To print text and number together we can put all of that in a single printf statement:

      Example: printf("This is lesson %d of C", 3);

         // Output:
        // This is lesson 3 of C
'//' is for single line comment, " /* */ " is for multi line comment
