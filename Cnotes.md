 Semicolon [;] is imp
 
 "%d" and addition of "%d" and spacing is imp
 
 "\n" is "enter" to next line ---> also needed for the last new line
 
 To print text and number together we can put all of that in a single printf statement:

      Example: printf("No. of apples is %d" and I ate it all, 3);

         // Output:
        // No. of apples is 3 and I ate it all
'//' is for single line comment, " /* */ " is for multi line comment

## Day - 2
int (just like in.py), assigned for any interger and that variable can be labelled any name and can be used in a string.

    eg: #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    
    int age = 25;
    printf("%d", age);
    }

Data type with eg:
   
     int num = 100000;
     long long large_num = 100000000000000;
     float pi = 3.14;
     double euler_number = 2.718281828459045;
     char c = 'A';
     bool check = true;
