## 4] Disease tester

## 5] Purification KeyChain: 

    Parts:

     Nano-filtration Membrane: 
     This is the heart of the device, responsible for removing contaminants from the water.
     Activated Carbon Filter: Helps to remove impurities and improve the taste of the water.
     Housing: Made of durable and lightweight materials to protect the internal components.
     Keychain Attachment: Allows users to easily carry the device with their keys.

    Materials:
    Nano-filtration Membrane: Typically made from materials like polymer or ceramic.
    Activated Carbon: High-quality activated carbon sourced from coconut shells or other natural materials.
    Housing: Can be made from plastic, aluminum, or stainless steel for durability.

    Method to Use:
    Fill: Unscrew the housing and fill the reservoir with water from any source - tap, river, lake, etc.
    Filter: Screw the housing back on securely. When you're ready to drink, simply squeeze the device to force the water through the filters.
    Drink: Purified water will flow out of the nozzle, ready to drink.

    Users:
    Village Residents: People in villages often have limited access to clean drinking water. This device could be invaluable for them, allowing them to purify water from local sources.
    City Dwellers: While tap water in cities is generally safe to drink, some people prefer the taste of filtered water. Additionally, in emergencies like natural disasters where water supply might be compromised, this device could be a lifesaver.
    Travelers: Whether hiking in the wilderness or backpacking through foreign countries, travelers often encounter questionable water sources. A portable purification device like this would give them peace of mind knowing they can always have access to clean water.
    This water purification keychain would offer a simple yet effective solution for improving water quality in various settings, empowering people to stay hydrated wherever they are.
