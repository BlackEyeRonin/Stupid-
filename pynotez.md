The word print that you can see here is a function name.

A function (in this context) is a separate part of the computer code able to:
--> cause some effect 
--> evaluate a value and return it as the function's result
Python gives you the ability to create your own custom functions. (yoho!, user-defined func.)
string: the text between parantheses is not code. It isn't intended to be executed, and you should take it as is. (has data only)
The function name (print in this case) along with the parentheses and argument(s), forms the function invocation.
The effect is very useful and very spectacular. The function:

takes its arguments (it may accept more than one argument and may also accept less than one argument)
converts them into human-readable form if needed (as you may suspect, strings don't require this action, as the string is already readable)
and sends the resulting data to the output device (usually the console); in other words, anything you put into the print() function will appear on your screen.
Python requires that "there cannot be more than one instruction in a line."
The backslash (\) has a very special meaning when used inside strings - this is called the escape character.
The letter n placed after the backslash comes from the word newline.
the print() function puts a space between the outputted arguments on its own initiative.
The way in which we are passing the arguments into the print() function is the most common in Python, and is called the positional way (this name comes from the fact that the meaning of the argument is dictated by its position, e.g., the second argument will be outputted after the first, not the other way round).

On contrary to positional way,

The mechanism is called keyword arguments. The name stems from the fact that the meaning of these arguments is taken not from its location (position) but from the special word (keyword) used to identify them.
eg 1 : end="" (for print func.)
eg 2 : sep="" (for print func.)

Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.
